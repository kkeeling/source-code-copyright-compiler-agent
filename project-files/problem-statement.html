    <h1>Problem Statement: Source Code Copyright Compiler</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The Source Code Copyright Compiler is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of preparing source code for copyright submission. This tool addresses the need for an efficient and standardized method of compiling source code from a project into a format suitable for copyright registration.</p>

    <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
    <p>Software developers and companies often face difficulties when attempting to copyright their source code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual compilation of source code is time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
        <li>Inconsistent formatting and organization can lead to issues during the copyright registration process.</li>
        <li>Important files may be overlooked, while less relevant files might be given undue prominence.</li>
        <li>There's no standardized way to present the project structure alongside the source code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>The Source Code Copyright Compiler will address these challenges by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automating the process of extracting source code from a project root folder.</li>
        <li>Creating a well-formatted MS Word document containing the first 200 lines of each source file.</li>
        <li>Organizing the document to first display the overall project folder structure.</li>
        <li>Presenting the source code in order of importance, with the most critical files appearing first.</li>
        <li>Ensuring proper formatting and headers throughout the document.</li>
        <li>Formatting code as distinct code blocks for improved readability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Command-line interface for easy integration into development workflows.</li>
        <li>Automatic scanning and processing of the project root folder.</li>
        <li>Intelligent ordering of files based on importance (algorithm to be determined).</li>
        <li>Generation of a complete project folder structure.</li>
        <li>Creation of a properly formatted MS Word document.</li>
        <li>Code block formatting for all included source code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Upon completion, this tool will significantly reduce the time and effort required to prepare source code for copyright submission. It will ensure consistency in formatting and organization, potentially improving the success rate of copyright applications. Additionally, it will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the project structure, enhancing the understanding of the software's architecture for copyright examiners.</p>
